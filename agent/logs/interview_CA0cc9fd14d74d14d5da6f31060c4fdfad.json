I have also published multiple research papers, uh, on training models and NLP. And, um,  and I want to pursue, uh,  Ai and Engineering further. In my career, I want to grow in this direction.  Oh wow."

      "content": "Thank you for sharing that, Vaibhavee! It sounds like you have a strong foundation in AI and cloud computing, along with some impressive accomplishments in research. Could you tell me more about how your experience as an AI Engineering Intern at Scopely has shaped your skills and knowledge in the field? What have been some key learnings or experiences during your time there?"

      "content": "Um, let's go play. I learned, uh, I had built multiple AI projects for a personal project, but I had never worked in an Enterprise level, um, uh, AI project but at scopely, I finally understood how the system work. How we can use AI in real time, how we can optimize, how we can optimize all the workflows using AI Etc. And currently, we are building a centralized platform for uh for uh an internal tool on an internal tool, which would help development of games throughout the organization."

You mentioned building multiple AI projects personally\u2014could you elaborate on a specific project you are most proud of? What was your role in that project, what technologies did you use, and what was the impact of your work?"

It seems like you might be referring to your personal projects, but could you clarify or expand on one of the significant projects you worked on? Perhaps you could highlight the objectives and outcomes and any challenges you faced during the development process? Your insights could be really valuable!"

Oh overall, in the organization, it could have it would be synced, it would be an RA application, which would have, um, context of everything. So I'm currently work on development of that, which would be used by more than 3,000 people.  Overall."

      "content": "That sounds like a significant project, Vaibhavee! Developing an internal tool that will be utilized by over 3,000 people must come with its own set of challenges and responsibilities. Can you share more about the technologies you are using for this project and how you're ensuring that the AI models will perform effectively and meet the needs of a large user base? Additionally, how are you handling user feedback and incorporating it to optimize the tool?"

Over there. We are also thinking a lot of mCP tools, for example, GitHub mcpg Drive mCP, which um, conference your jira Etc, which were  Which would create a centralized platform, which would have  context."

Integrating various platforms like JIRA to create a centralized context is a smart way to enhance productivity and collaboration within the organization.\n\nAs you're working through this development, have you encountered any significant challenges or obstacles? If so, how did you approach resolving them? It would be interesting to hear how you handle problem-solving in a project of this scale."
